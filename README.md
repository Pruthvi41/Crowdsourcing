# Crowdsourcing

Approach to the problem:
- I have used ReactJs to display frontend of the application with all the required fields and added client side validation. Added routing for home page and Userdata. 
- Connected MongoDB database using ExpressJs.
- Written Duck schema and used the schema for POST method to save the data into the database.
- Retreived the data using GET method in the server.
- Finally used axios inside ReactJs in order to make POST and GET requests for displaying of user provided data.

Technologies chosen: ReactJs, MongoDB and ExpressJs
- I have used this technologies because of my experience working with these technologies during professional and acadamic experience. Apart from that, I like working with ReactJs because of its use of components anywhere and ExpressJs because of its easy usage.

It took me around 4 hours in order to complete the assessment where I took 1 hour to write the frontend, 1 hour for POST method, 1hr 30 mins in order make GET request in the server and for the data retrieval in the frontend, and around 30 mins to make final changes.

Steps to run the application:
1. Download the file from the Github.
2. Go to the directory outside the client folder using cmd
3. Type the command "npm i" to install node modules.
4. Now go inside the client folder 
5. Type the same command "npm i".
6. Now move back to the directory outside the cliend folder.
7. Run "npm run dev" command so that the application opens up in the browser.
